# Team Profile Generator

## Description

The motivation and purpose behind this project was to make a hub to store and organize information on employees. It solves the problem of not having a hub that can be used as a quick reference when searching for information on employees. I learned a lot about implementing and running tests, as well as further using node to generate files.
